mediaLibrary
============

First small project I did with PHP and SQL over a year ago.
I'm a little embarrased to show this because knowing what I know now I can see all of its defects. I can 
clearly see how html could be improved by the use of css. There are also a lot of pages which are redudant, as well
as some tables that could be changed. I thought I'd include it to show my first steps and mistakes when I
first had hands on PHP.



README FOR MY PROJECT:

Page viewable at http://mpena5.net84.net/default.php

This folder contains 26 PHP Files and 10 image files which altogether make up the media library program.

****************************************************************************

Overview:

This program, as required in the project description, implements a Media Library System which allows 
the user to add, modify and remove multimedia files of different types, such as: Music, Video, Movies, 
Podcasts, and Audiobooks. These “files” are only data records, and are not actual media files.

This program also allows the user to create, modify and remove Playlists. If modifying a Playlist, 
the user can rename the playlist, add a file to it or delete it.

The program also has a multi-user sign-in system. Each user’s library is independent from the 
others’, as well as their playlists. Therefore, users can only modify their library and their playlists. 


****************************************************************************

How to use:

The user must enter a username to begin using the system.
Then, the user will be able to navigate through the menus by clicking on the images representing actions. 
To begin with, the user will be able to choose from either managing multimedia files or managing playlists.
If the user selects manage multimedia files, the options to add, modify, or remove a file become available.
Once the user selects an option, a few questions will be prompted so user can add, modify, or delete 
a specific media file.
If the user selects Manage Playlists from the initial menu, the options to add, modify or delete a playlist
will become available. When selecting an action, a few questions will be prompted so the user can add, modify, 
or delete a playlist.
The user can log out at any time by clicking on the “Log out” button located at the bottom center of every page.
